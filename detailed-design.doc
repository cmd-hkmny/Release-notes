# Detailed Design Document for Scaling DevOps Automation POCs

## 1. POC Description

### 1.1 Automated Release Notes Creation
This POC automates the generation of release notes during the Azure DevOps release process. It collects work items and changesets associated with a release, formats them into a readable markdown or HTML format, and publishes them as part of the release artifacts.

**Key Features:**
- Retrieves linked work items and commits
- Formats information using templates
- Publishes notes to release artifacts or sends via email

### 1.2 Automated PROD Stage Creation with Health Checks and Rollbacks
This POC automates the addition of a standardized PROD stage to classic Azure DevOps release pipelines. It includes post-deployment health checks and a rollback mechanism.

**Key Features:**
- Clones and modifies pre-existing stage to create a standardized PROD stage
- Inserts PowerShell-based health check tasks
- Enables automatic rollback on failed health checks
- Uses a config file (JSON/CSV) for dynamic values

---

## 2. Scaling the POCs to 100+ Applications

To apply this solution across 100+ applications:

### 2.1 Centralized Configuration
- Use centralized configuration files (e.g., JSON/CSV) stored in a Git repo for each app
- Each config includes pipeline ID, web app name, server paths, approval groups

### 2.2 Parameterized Templates
- Convert YAML and PowerShell into reusable templates with parameters
- Trigger templates via pipeline variables or UI inputs

### 2.3 Batch Execution
- Create a meta-pipeline that loops through applications using their config
- Run `release-notes.ps1` and `create-prod-stage.ps1` for each entry

### 2.4 Governance and Auditing
- Include logging and versioning of changes per app
- Track rollout status in a dashboard (e.g., Power BI, Excel log)

---

## 3. Architecture Summary

**Components:**
- Azure DevOps Pipelines (YAML)
- PowerShell scripts
- Azure DevOps Classic Release Pipelines
- Config repository (JSON/CSV)

**Flow:**
1. DevOps pipeline reads config
2. Calls PowerShell script to modify release definition
3. Adds PROD stage with health check + rollback
4. For release notes, pipeline triggers post-release, collects metadata, and publishes notes

```
+--------------------+          +-------------------+
|   YAML Pipeline    | -------> | PowerShell Script |
+--------------------+          +-------------------+
        |                                 |
        v                                 v
+--------------------+         +-----------------------------+
| Config File (Git)  |<------->| Azure DevOps Release Defs   |
+--------------------+         +-----------------------------+
```

## 4. Conceptual Data Model (if applicable)

### Config Model
```json
{
  "PipelineId": 123,
  "WebApplicationName": "App1",
  "DeploymentRoot": "D:\\Deployments",
  "Machines": ["Server1", "Server2"],
  "ApprovalGroupId": "GUID"
}
```
Used by both automation tasks to customize behavior per application.

---

## 5. User Access Controls

### ADO Permissions
- Only project contributors can run pipelines
- PAT stored in Azure DevOps Library with secret variable group
- Health check and rollback scripts run under service connection identity

### Approval Groups
- PROD stage includes manual approval from specified AAD group
- Group ID passed via config

---

## 6. Application Security

- PAT (Personal Access Token) stored securely in Azure DevOps variable groups
- No credentials hardcoded
- Health check endpoints use HTTPS and support TLS 1.2
- PowerShell scripts sanitized and input validated

---

## 7. Performance

### Current Manual Process:
- Release Notes: ~15 mins
- PROD Stage Configuration: ~15 mins
- Total: ~30 mins per application

### Post-Automation:
- Release Notes: ~1-2 mins
- PROD Stage Automation: ~1-2 mins
- 90%+ time savings per application
- Parallel execution scales efficiently

---

## 8. Service Introduction Plan

### Documentation & Onboarding
- Provide user guide for DevOps team
- Sample configuration for new apps
- Schedule knowledge transfer sessions

### Operational Readiness
- Integrate into CI/CD onboarding process
- Use pilot apps to validate new deployments
- Add monitoring/logging for execution failures

---

## 9. Infrastructure Services Used

- Azure DevOps Pipelines (YAML + Classic Release)
- Azure DevOps Variable Groups
- Hosted Microsoft agents (windows-latest)
- PowerShell Core
- Git for config storage

**Optional Extensions:**
- Azure Monitor for endpoint tracking
- Power BI for status dashboards
- Key Vault for centralized secret management

  Automated Release Pipeline Management System
Design Document for Scaling to 100+ Applications

1. POC Description
1.1 Automated Release Notes Creation
Objective: Automatically generate release notes for Azure DevOps pipelines by extracting work items, commits, and PRs associated with each release.

Key Features:

Fetches work items (User Stories, Bugs, Tasks) linked to the build

Includes commit messages and PR descriptions

Formats release notes in Markdown/HTML

Publishes to Azure Wiki/SharePoint/Teams

Technologies Used:

Azure DevOps REST API (for work items, builds, releases)

PowerShell (data processing and formatting)

Azure Pipelines YAML (orchestration)

1.2 Automated PROD Stage Creation, Health Checks & Rollbacks
Objective: Automate the creation of a PROD stage in existing release pipelines with built-in health checks and rollback mechanisms.

Key Features:

PROD Stage Automation: Clones pre-prod stage and configures approvals

Health Checks: Validates API/IIS status before deployment

Auto-Rollback: Reverts to last stable version if health checks fail

JSON/CSV Config: Supports per-application settings

Technologies Used:

Azure DevOps Release API

PowerShell (for health checks & IIS rollback)

JSON Configuration (application-specific settings)

2. Scaling to 100+ Applications
2.1 Centralized Configuration Management
Single JSON/CSV file storing:

json
{
    "applications": [
        {
            "pipelineId": 123,
            "name": "App1",
            "servers": ["Server1", "Server2"],
            "deploymentRoot": "C:\\Deployments\\App1",
